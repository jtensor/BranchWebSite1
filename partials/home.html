	Once I was a physicist.  I received my Bachelor's of Science in Applied Physics with a minor in Mathematics from Brigham Young University.  Then I was a stay at home mom.  I made sure my kids didn't cause too much bodily harm to themselves or others.  Now I am a web developer.  I use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Angular, Express, Node, and Firebase to create websites.  Next I will ….
	</br>  Truthfully, I have no idea what I will do next.  I’m enjoying web developing.  There is enough re-invention in the scope of web developing to keep me busy for a very long time.  And I like that.

		Why the π? Pi is a fascinating thing.  It’s exact value is unknowable (just like so much of life).  Computers have been able to calculate it out to billions of digits but haven’t found any kind of a repeatable pattern so far.  The digits of pi continue all the way to infinity.  Pi is found in many different areas.  Obviously it is found in circles where it is the ratio of the circumference to it’s diameter.  Pi appears in the spiral of the DNA double helix, the pupil of an eye, the concentric rings on the water after a splash.  It is also found in the Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle and other probability equations.  In a collection of random whole numbers, the probability that any 2 numbers have no common factor is equal to 6/πr^2.  It is also found in the shape of rivers.  Rivers have a ‘meandering ratio’ which is the ratio of the river’s actual length to the distance as a crow flies from its headwaters to it’s mouth.  The average meandering ratio of rivers approaches pi.  Who knew?  Well, Albert Einstein did.  He used fluid dynamics and chaos theory to explain why and how.  And in his theory of relativity, pi is important since time and space are curved.  So much of physics is math and most if not all of the math used in relativistic physics uses pi.

		That’s cool, but so what?  Soon after I married, I made a monogram of my initials and I realized that the stylized J T looked very like π.  Every time I initial my kids’ homework or anything else I think about pi. Between my physics background and my new monogram, I couldn’t help but have a fascination with pi.
